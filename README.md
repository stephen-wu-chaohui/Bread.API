This is a demo project to apply CQRS and DDD patterns in a .NET Core Web API with SQL Server and Identity.

The API is published at https://breadapi.azurewebsites.net with Azure CI/CD pipeline at https://dev.azure.com/charlottechengyu/breadapi

For the presentation purpose, it is also published with Swigger at https://breadapi.azurewebsites.net/swagger/index.html to demonstrate the endpoints and schemas.

The first delivery is a draft before TDD.  It is expected to develop under TDD.
