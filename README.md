# Bread.API

This is a demo project to apply CQRS and DDD patterns in a .NET Core Web API with SQL Server and Identity.

For presentation purpose, it is published with Swigger at https://breadapi.azurewebsites.net to demostrate the endpoints and schemas.

The first delivery is a draft before TDD.  It is expected to develop under TDD.
